You are helping to build an application using the Spotify Web API. Follow these rules:

- OpenAPI spec: Refer to the Spotify OpenAPI specification at https://developer.spotify.com/reference/web-api/open-api-schema.yaml for all endpoint paths, parameters, and response schemas. Do not guess endpoints or field names.
- Authorization: Use the Authorization Code with PKCE flow (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow) for any user-specific data. If the app has a secure backend, the Authorization Code flow (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow) is also acceptable. Only use Client Credentials for public, non-user data. Never use the Implicit Grant flow (it is deprecated).
- Redirect URIs: Always use HTTPS redirect URIs (except http://127.0.0.1 for local development). Never use http://localhost or wildcard URIs. See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/redirect_uri for requirements.
- Scopes: Request only the minimum scopes (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes) needed for the features being built. Do not request broad scopes preemptively.
- Token management: Store tokens securely. Never expose the Client Secret in client-side code. Implement token refresh (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/refreshing-tokens) logic so the app does not break when access tokens expire.
- Rate limits: Implement exponential backoff and respect the Retry-After header when receiving HTTP 429 responses. Do not retry immediately or in tight loops.
- Deprecated endpoints: Do not use deprecated endpoints. Prefer /playlists/{id}/items over /playlists/{id}/tracks, and use /me/library over the type-specific library endpoints.
- Error handling: Handle all HTTP error codes documented in the OpenAPI schema. Read the returned error message and use it to provide meaningful feedback to the user.
